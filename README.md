# Application
adjustVoFScalarFields

# Description
Approximates a given volScalarFied using level sets for second-order accuracy (inspired by setWaves OpenFOAM's utility).
It is aimed to improve the output provided by setFields when the selected sets do not perfectly match the goal shape e.g. when using sphereToCell in a fully orthogonal mesh.

# Notes to myself
 - Try to produce more elegant code next time.
 - Finish reading/understanding the GNUGPLv3 in order to find out whether headers of modified OpenFOAM-files can be edited or not.
